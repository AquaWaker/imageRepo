Name: Brayden Pritchard

Program is run with: java -jar build/libs/imageRepo.jar

Features:
This small program allows you to add a list of images to the program then have those images "uploaded".
Since I don't have a remote server I set it up so that the images are saved into a specific folder in the
program and the program can reload the images from this folder.

The Add button allows you to select an image, and will stop the process if an invalid image is chosen
*Note* PDFs do not work with the program as it converts images into PNGs to save them

The Save butten allows you to "upload" the images that have been added to the folder where all the images 
are stored so that they can be seen once more once the program is reloaded
