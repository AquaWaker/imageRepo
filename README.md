Name: Brayden Pritchard

Program is run with: java -jar build/libs/imageRepo.jar

Features:
This small program allows you to add a list of images to the program then have those images "uploaded".
Since I don't have a remote server I set it up so that the images are serialized and saved to a location
specified by the user.

The Add button allows you to select an image, and will stop the process if an invalid image is chosen
The Save button serializes all the images into one file to be saved somewhere.
